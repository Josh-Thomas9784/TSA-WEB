        <h2>Special Thanks to: </h2>
        <h1>Mrs Rausch</h1>
        <p>Mrs Rausch has been an integral part of LCHS TSA for 25 years.
          Through out the years, she has guided and mentored countless students, leading them to a successful future. She's made strives in national TSA and influenced much of what the organization is today. 
          Starting the TSA chapter at Lamar, her tenacity and dedication brought LCHS TSA to what it is today.
          We'll be sad to see her go but she will always have a special place in our hearts. Thank you Mrs. Raush!  </p>

        <h1>Hayden Cheng</h1>
        <p>Hayden Cheng strived to make the LCHS TSA a successful chapter. As the 2023-2024 TSA state Secretary he not only influenced us but also Texas TSA as a whole. 
          His willingness and confidence helped create a strong TSA environment for those around him and his chapter. He graduated 2nd in his class and now currently attends John Hopkins 
          University. His presence in LCHS will never be forgotten, leaving a lasting impact on us and his friends.
